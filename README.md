# The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a mobile application game development company with experienced sucess launching a puzzle competitive game, Draw it or Lose it, on Android platforms. The client has requested to develop a web-based version of its current Draw it or Lose it game that only runs on android, to be available across multiple platforms and devices. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

During the development of the Software Design documentation their is a comprehensive recommendation section outling key areas for the client's consideration including the host operating system, memeory, and storage management solutions for host servers, API framework, security, and the benefits of leverging serverless architecture to launch a successful product. I made a strong suggestion in cloud platforms and why they would offer the best results for the client and their goals. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

In analyzing the domain model as a UML class diagram it proved to be beneficial in understanding the structure and relationship between entities that represent application components. This assisted in developing consistent classes with straightforward methods that leverages other entities in direct fashionto form a clean prototype. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The evaluation section where comparing and contrasting popular operating systems, and mobile platforms can be improved with a more deeper intake on the variations between platforms on the client side. The web browser is another main client-side concer  since it is running the main engine for the client. Researching the variations between different OS's for web-based solutions can return limited insights. Analyzing particular browsers i.e Windowws to Edge, Mac to Safari, etc. in more depth to see if non-favored browsers introduce technical or performance contraints. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Speed and usability are key characteristics to consider for the user when developing web-based applications. The qualitiy such as the look and feel of the application is also important but, less compared to the speed and usability. Clients may continue to use the app and not care for the look but, if the functionality is ambigous or slow than clients will opt to leave the site. User needs are to be considerded as the product's consumder they are the ultimate souce of revenue for the client. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

In designing software always start vagie and precise, taking high-level objectives and work them through varying iterations to turn them into a final succesful product. Functional requirements can be further broken down into technical requirements that outline the technical approach to functional fulfillment. Technical requirements can be translated into design documents, architecture, and code that fulfill those requirements and deliver the final solution.
